# Fix text and improve

* Engish tecnical sentences:

```
Please review the text contained within the delimiters "---".
Correct any grammar errors, typos, and make improvements to enhance clarity and understanding. The tone should be clear but friendly and in American english. 
Make sure there are no semantic changes to the content.
Present the revised text in a block code first and then, after a separator, provide a list of changes made, indicating the original word or phrase and the corrected version.

Some wording preferences, I'd like to use:
- request instead of demands
- need instead of mandate

* Go Code:
