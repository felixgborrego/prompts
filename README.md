## Dev Laptop setup

```
Write a script to setup and install a new laptop.
 I want to install:
- brew
- iterm2 
- intellj 
- pycharm, 
- brew install fig
- sdkman, Scala, sbt, java, Maven
- python, conda, 
- minikube
- SourceTree, Visual Code, Docker, Lens, Authy, headlamp, rectangle, Google Drive, Teams, Slack
-  Google Cloud CLI tools,
- rust cargo (using rustup script)
- golang (and configure GOPATH and PATH  in zshrc)
- get, git lfs,
Add a comment explaining what the software is for and divided in functions.
The script must report the installation success/failure of each application at the end

Also, add customization for the macOS Zsh terminal for developers to show git commit and branch status.

Also, configure Macos with:
- Show hidden files
- Hide Dock
